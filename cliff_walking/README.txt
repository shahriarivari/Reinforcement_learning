in this problem we want to go from the start point to the finish point.(check the image cliff_walking_problem.bmp)
for position we used an excel file to demonstrate where the cliff is and where the path is.
by indexing we could find where we are in the map.
epsilon_greedy.m -------> is to find a new action based on the Q table and the state
find_state_number.m -------> turns the state matrix in to an index
movement.m -------> takes the action and the state and gives the new state
on_track -------> checks if the agent has hit the cliff or has gone off the track
start.m -------> gives the start state matrix
update_Q_learning.m -------> computes and updates the Q table
cliff_walking.m is the main code
